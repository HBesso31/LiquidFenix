# LiquidFenix
 Decentralized world improving

The Liquid Fenix DAO is looking for researchers, professionals and entrepreneurs that share the passion for improving the World we all received. That’s why we are designing in a complete decentralized and co-proprietary way the common-good market for impact innovation.

Our goal is to launch the common-good stock market to crowdfund through a cooperative-business approach the Research, Development and Implementation of solutions to reach the Sustainable Development Goals while enabling both the 2.3 billion people that are out the monetary system and the rest of us to have a means of life and joy by contributing to global improvement by putting to work our spare time, unused assets and available capital.

There are 6 elements that conform the Liquid Fenix approach:

1. Open collaboration platform and a single digital marketplace: Space to reach out mission-oriented projects and best practices around the world by open challenges as Horizon Europe is, in two ways:
I. Already backed-up projects by a budget which are looking for crowd intelligence and community engagement;
II. New projects that are being co-created by the community to apply for an available challenge, such as Horizon Europe and other SDG oriented missions.
Both of these project types may participate as follows:
Projects vary in risk and time required both to research and to development, reason why they are presented in three modalities:
(1) Pathfinder: Projects ranging from early technology to pre-commercial that aim to RDI on disruptive technologies for achieving a specific mission-area.
(2) Accelerator: Innovative SMEs with pre-commercial to market & scale-up projects looking to develop new products, services and business models that could drive economic growth and shape new markets or disrupt existing ones in Europe and worldwide. 
(3) Non-commercial use: Best practices and basic research that do not seek or is not (yet) able to be commercialized. Funding this projects won’t return on investment by the project IP, but may provide by using other mechanisms as incentives like tradable crypto-collectibles.
Besides this, a future feature is adding an Online store where users and members can cash-out their earnings to buy products and services that are aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Mission-areas or shared prosperity pursue such as Fair-trade, B Corps, Co-ops, and any other traditional firm complying with these. This will close the circle of prosperity economy.

2. Open, Permissionless and Contributive Accounting system: Any worldwide user is able to get Shares of any listed project through: directly buying them with capital, earning them by task fulfillment or trading them for owned assets.	
The types of contributions are here detailed:

Capital: This type of contribution is only available when Project tokens are on the sale phase, which is only when the project has received approval either by the challenge sponsor (like Horizon Europe) or by Liquid’s General Assembly.
Assets:  Each project will specify if required any type of asset for its success. Either way if not requested any user can directly contact the team to offer and negotiate its token-related value. Some examples of asset sharing are patents, equipment and real estate.
Tasks: This type of contribution is possible in each of the project’s life cycle and is presented in any of the following forms as bounties1:
Open to members:
    • Reviews.  The whole community is looking for those projects that offer the best opportunities to impact for good in the most profitable, sustainable and socially conscious ways possible. Thus, a ranking system is applied among all listed projects to provide transparent analysis and feedback of each project in terms of: team’s potential, IP’s competitive advantages and feasibility in legal, financial, technical, commercial and mission-oriented terms, as well as their score towards genuine progress and shared prosperity2.
    • Audit. The follow up and audit of financial states, operations and regulatory compliance will be asked to the team to present them as well to the community to review them. This will be required by the platform once the project has arrived to a commercial stage.
    • Management. These tasks are only related to Liquid and require a specific level of reputation to apply.
Open to any user:
    • Research and Development. Each project will specify areas where community participation is required ranging from simple/complex tasks to job positions as for example: design a logo, curate a database or hire a Communication manager.
    
3. Fair wealth distribution system: When users participate in Liquid tasks they get rewarded with a Reputation Score, which acts as signal for surplus distribution from overall’s network net income. This only applies to Liquid shares and not to other projects available in the platform.

4. Blockchain and AI: A mix of the best practices and lessons from the worldwide community in these 11 years of blockchain experiences:
        I. DAICO: A global co-ownership firm characterized by transparency, accountability and liquidity, based on continuous fundraising campaigns with bonding curves for automated price adjustment.
        II. AI: Artificial Intelligence will be used to improve the decision making processes that have been identified as friction areas in investment, recruitment and price-setting. Specifically the platform will be enabled with:
            ▪ A Robo-Advisor for better decision making on where, when and how to invest;
            ▪ An ethical, ‘no wrong-door’ and gamifyed profile assessment for recruiting Reviewers;
            ▪ Automated benchmark of task rewards in outside market to assist the Board Members on price-setting.

5. Open Knowledge and Tokenized Intellectual Property: In line with the EU principle of Open Science, all research data shall be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable allowing for free personal use but enabling direct reward to all its co-creators from every commercialization practice either done by the original or any subsequent version.
Through the use of blockchain and token-economics, the platform will enable open science while protecting the commercial rights of the involved innovators. 

6. Governance of the digital commons: Following the Ostrom’s principles5 Liquid is governed using:
        I. Multi-stakeholder. Open access to any individual or organization willing to become a member.
        II. Commons-based. This means that this platform is identified as a right for all humanity.
        III. Co-Op. Type of organization based on democratic member control and equal rights; member economic participation; autonomy and independence; concern for community education, training and information; co-operation among other mission-oriented individuals and networks; and constituted for Prosperity Gains (see note 2).
        IV. Common good stock market: Business activity of the platform and a means for achieving the SDGs.
